# Welcome to Ader!

<b>Ader</b> is a platform for facilitating advertising activities by allowing social-media users to generate advertising content. Advertisers place offers which users accept and fulfill.

My customer will be any person that is interested in starting a business or investing in
advertising.<br>
Customer will benefit from business growth and profit gains resulting from the offering of
high quality services and friendly UI that the users get to experience.

One of the reasons i chose this project is because i have it as a project for my bachelor's degree at university. Another reason is the fact that i have never done anything like this. It involves many things that I'll be doing for the first time. The idea is also part of the advertising domain, which is a new one for me. I’m sure i’ll learn a lot out of all this. It should prove challenging, which is the point of this program.

### Current progress
The project is just beginning. As of right now, i have a Maven project with 2 modules: Backend and Frontend. The Backend module is a Spring boot application and the Frontend module is an Angular application. The project builds and launches successfully.

### Future plans
First of all, i have to implement the user groups: User, Advertiser and Administrator, and make an authentication system. User logs in with Facebook, Advertiser has to register directly on the site and Administrator has full control.
