# Welcome to Ader!

<b>Ader</b> is a platform for facilitating advertising activities by allowing social-media users to generate advertising content. Advertisers place offers which users accept and fulfill.

My customer will be any person that is interested in starting a business or investing in
advertising.<br>
Customer will benefit from business growth and profit gains resulting from the offering of
high quality services and friendly UI that the users get to experience.

One of the reasons i chose this project is because i have it as a project for my bachelor's degree at university. Another reason is the fact that i have never done anything like this. It involves many things that I'll be doing for the first time. The idea is also part of the advertising domain, which is a new one for me. I’m sure i’ll learn a lot out of all this. It should prove challenging, which is the point of this program.

### Current progress
The project currently has 3 modules: Backend, Frontend and Admin. The Backend module has most of it's entity schema complete. It has logging (Logback), database migration (Liquibase) and Security (OAuth2). The Frontend module only has the home page and the Log in page (which works). The Admin module is used for monitoring the Backend application and allows us to change the loglevel at runtime, as well as give us a lot of other useful information.

### Future plans
Further develop the Backend application: add the proper bussiness logic for offer creation, bid creation, and advertising status handling. Also, further Frontend module work is required. Will try to make it look as close to the prototype as possible.
